The execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n\nFinally, the decorated function returns both the result and the execution time.\n\n**Usage**\n--------\n\nTo use this decorator, simply apply it to a function you want to measure:\n\n```python\n@timer_decorator\ndef my_function():\n    # Code to be executed...\n```\n\nWhen `my_function` is called, it will return not only its result but also its execution time."
